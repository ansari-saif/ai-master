        step 6:
            develop a connect to notion feature

        step 7:
            develop a connect to figma feature

        step 8:
            develop a connect to github feature

        step 9:
            Connect oll of em
            
        step 10:
            then productionsed all of these for free or discuss with Harkirat to launch on productHunt (Should be a money making model)

        step 11:
            list all of listing like betaList, and discuss this on reddit 
        
        step 12:
            take a coding break publish everywhere like likendIn and all 
        
        step 13:
            show this to your high value connections like Vanshul, Shilpa etc

        step 14:
            take real statup probelem agar kahi se mil gya to like vanshul or shilpa and solve their problem 



    Module 6:
        step 1:
            then you've the data what people are facing problems
            then solve their problem start coding again 
            make this version really useful
            introduce more modules according to your research
        
        step 2:
            integrate WebSocket, Redis, RabbitMQ, Email, Whatapp, sms,  Notification and webhook.site
        
        step 3:
            introduce cms for static content
        
        step 4:
            Now looking for funding

    Module 7:
        step 1:
            Now you got a funding Now you've to build a team 
        
        step 2:
            replace locofy scraping to with builder.io 
        step 4:
            use https://plopjs.com/ or https://www.chromatic.com/ or tools like this
        step 5:
            introduce coolify
        
        step 4:
            make our modules more configurable and better code
            we'll use bolt.new in our code

        
        step 5: 
            stipe or rozarpay or make it configurable
            will introduce these module
